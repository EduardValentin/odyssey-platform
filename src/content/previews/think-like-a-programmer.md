For every programmer, it's really important to have a good understanding of logic. Although modern programming languages are much easier to understand and use, it's worth keeping in mind that every line of code is essentially a series of logical operations on bits of 0 and 1. So, in other words, a computer program is just a bunch of logical operations on binary digits - even though this might not be immediately obvious in the code itself. But don't worry, with a little bit of practice, you'll be writing amazing programs in no time at all!
