Every programmer needs to understand logic in order to write programs. A computer program essentially consists of logical operations on zeroes and ones, also known as bits. It's important to grasp the role of propositional logic when working with bits. Although modern programming languages are easier to read and use, at the core, every line of code boils down to logical operations on bits of 0 and 1.

Types of operators in propositional logic include:

* <span class="text-rose">Conjunction (And):</span> Symbol: **&** 
* <span class="text-rose">Disjunction (Or):</span> Symbol: **||** 
* <span class="text-rose">Negation (Not):</span> Symbol: **!** 
* <span class="text-rose">Implication:</span> Symbol: **->**
* <span class="text-rose">Equivalence:</span> Symbol:  **<->**
